Continue tutorial and try implementing things in <RecentTweets />

Logs:
ownComponents = components that I make myself (my idea for improv and translating from /pages to /app)

somehow the fix from the tutorial for the "What's happening" textarea height when page is refreshed, does not work

On 48.24
The solution here is not applied and I didn't make a seperate form function because there are no errors in my terminal, even though there is on Kyle's

An attempt kinda worked by making the <Form /> it's own component (have not been fully tested and continued yet), try to receive the props needed for <Form /> next
--> Working, accepted

FINALLY I CAN QUERY AND INSERT TO DATABASE ASDFGHJKL (works). The problem is in tweet.ts, you can't use ctx.prisma, instead it seems like in the app router you use ctx.db

<RecentTweets /> is made to it's own component to be able to implement client functions
