Try to make a server session for client pages/components

Logs:
ownComponents = components that I make myself (my idea for improv and translating from /pages to /app)

somehow the fix from the tutorial for the "What's happening" textarea height when page is refreshed, does not work

On 48.24
The solution here is not applied and I didn't make a seperate form function because there are no errors in my terminal, even though there is on Kyle's

An attempt kinda worked by making the <Form /> it's own component (have not been fully tested and continued yet), try to receive the props needed for <Form /> next
--> Working, accepted

FINALLY I CAN QUERY AND INSERT TO DATABASE ASDFGHJKL (works). The problem is in tweet.ts, you can't use ctx.prisma, instead it seems like in the app router you use ctx.db

<RecentTweets /> is made to it's own component to be able to implement client functions

Moved session checking to page.tsx. So now, if the user is not logged in at all, there will be no tweet form or recent tweets.
So I've decided that in <HeartButton /> in 1:17:31 to not be made (this far)

Gave up and finally use SessionProvider so I can use useSession(). So far only used in <HeartButton />
